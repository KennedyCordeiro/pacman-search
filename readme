You can run all of the test cases on your code by opening a terminal and executing the command:

    $ python autograder.py

You can also run individual test cases by executing the command (you can replace "q1" with any of the choices q1-q8):

    $ python autograder.py -q q1

To watch a Pac-Man game progress, use the `pacman.py` script to animate the agent searching various domains (see commands.txt for instructions).
